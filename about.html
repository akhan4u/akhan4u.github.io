## About


Hello, my name is Amaan Khan and I'm a Devops Engineer by profession who loves to work on OpenSource Technologies and Linux. I  usually spend by weekend on learning New stuff, Reading, Cycling and Listening Music.

<i><b>The name Amaan (pronounced Am-aan), means 'The most Lovable' in Slavic; and in Arabic, 'Trustworthy and Without fear'</b></i> <br>

Writing articles is hard, but making up designs is fun. I made this site so I would be able to do both. Nothing brings me more pleasure than making something out of nothing. Even when the results are far from my ideal expectations, I find the whole ceremony of creativity completely enthralling. 
I'd like to think that I'm very happy person, but I find the art that strikes me truest is the sad, depressing sort. I love music; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Na4j8AVgA" target="_blank">'The Weeknd -Starboy'</a> being my favourite track, post-apocalyptic fiction, and movie trailers that can make me squirt tears in under two minutes. Go figure.
